OK. I need more information to create a plan, code, specs, and test for the amperage draw issue. Please provide the following:

1.  **Device Specifications:** What is the expected amperage draw of the unit? What is the maximum allowed amperage draw? What components are contributing to the amperage draw?
2.  **Operating Conditions:** Under what conditions was the amperage draw measured? (e.g., idle, full load, specific tasks running). What is the input voltage? What is the ambient temperature?
3.  **Hardware Details:** What microcontroller/processor is being used? What sensors and peripherals are connected? A block diagram would be helpful.
4.  **Software Details:** What operating system is being used? What software is running on the device? Are there any specific software modules that are suspected to be contributing to the high amperage draw?
5.  **Measurement Setup:** How was the amperage draw measured? What equipment was used? What was the sampling rate?
6.  **Failure Details:** What was the actual amperage draw measured during the failure? How often does the failure occur?

Once I have this information, I can create a plan to debug the issue, write code to monitor and control the amperage draw, create specifications for the system, and develop a test plan to ensure that the issue is resolved.
