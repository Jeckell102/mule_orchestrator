## Multi-Agent Consensus Engine for Hardware-Constrained Environments
- **Logged:** 2026-02-03 19:17:21
- **Problem:** AI agents generating code for physical robots often ignore mechanical stress or safety boundaries.
- **Solution:** A three-tier handshake protocol (Gatekeeper-Specialist-Consensus) requiring tokenized validation from distinct domain personas.
- **Search:** `("multi-agent" AND "consensus" AND "robotics" AND "code generation" AND "physical constraints")`

## Hardware-Safety-Governor (Pre-Flight Violation Check)
- **Logged:** 2026-02-03 19:17:21
- **Problem:** Autonomous agents may attempt commands exceeding physical ratings (e.g., motor torque or chassis load).
- **Solution:** A proactive regex filter cross-referencing user intent against a local Master Requirements Database to kill unsafe tasks before generation.
- **Search:** `("autonomous agent" AND "safety governor" AND "hardware limits" AND "proactive")`

## Self-Healing Logic Framework for Agentic Workflows
- **Logged:** 2026-02-03 19:17:21
- **Problem:** Agentic workflows frequently fail due to context drift or instruction misalignment over time.
- **Solution:** Capturing execution failures in a relational database and using a second-order Analyst agent to dynamically rewrite primary instruction sets.
- **Search:** `("AI" OR "LLM") AND (orchestrat* OR agent*) AND ("closed loop") AND (audit OR log*)`

## MRD-Driven Requirement Mapping for Decoupled Agent Logic
- **Logged:** 2026-02-03 19:17:21
- **Problem:** Hard-coding constraints into AI personas makes the system brittle and difficult to update as hardware evolves.
- **Solution:** A system where agent constraints are dynamically injected from a local relational database, allowing hardware upgrades without altering AI prompt logic.
- **Search:** `("AI agents" AND "requirements database" AND "dynamic injection" AND "robotics")`
