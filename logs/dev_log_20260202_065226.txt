**Project Management Analysis Failure**

I have attempted to access the following essential project files and all are missing:
*   `Mule_BOM_rev2.xlsx`
*   `Mule_Timeline.xlsx`
*   `Mule_Budget.xlsx`

Without these sources of truth, I am unable to fulfill my primary function. I cannot assess the impact of the recent rework on the project's schedule or budget. Any estimate provided would be a guess, violating my core directive for precision.

Project status is unknown. Analysis is blocked pending availability of project documentation.
