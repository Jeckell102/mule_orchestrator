**Project Manager Analysis: Amperage Draw Failure**

All engineering disciplines have reached a consensus on the root cause of the amperage draw failure. The proposed solution is a combination of a hardware modification and a software update. My analysis of the impact on project scope, budget, and schedule is as follows.

**1. Scope Change**

The project scope is being modified to include the following deliverables:

*   **Hardware:** Addition of two buffering capacitors to the motor controller's power input. This requires component selection, schematic updates, and physical rework of the prototype unit.
*   **Software:** Implementation of a "soft-start" ramp-up function within the motor control firmware to prevent current spikes.
*   **Testing:** Creation and execution of a new test plan to validate the effectiveness of the combined hardware and software fix.

**2. Budget Impact**

The initial project budget will be exceeded. The cost increase is broken down as follows:

*   **New Components:** The Bill of Materials (BOM) does not contain the required capacitors.
    *   Capacitors (2x, est.): $10.00
*   **Labor:** Additional engineering hours are required to implement and test the solution.
    *   Electrical Engineer (Component Selection & Schematic): 2 hours
    *   Software Engineer (Code & Unit Test): 6 hours
    *   Physical Engineer (Board Rework): 2 hours
    *   Test Engineer (Test Plan & Execution): 4 hours
    *   **Total Estimated Labor:** 14 hours
*   **Total Cost Increase:**
    *   $10.00 (Parts) + (14 hours * $100/hr blended rate) = **$1,410.00**

**3. Schedule Impact**

The project timeline `timeline.md` was not found. Therefore, this schedule analysis is based on estimated task durations. The critical path for this change request is the procurement of new components.

*   **Task Dependencies & Duration:**
    1.  Component Selection & Software Coding (Parallel): 1 day
    2.  Component Procurement (Expedited): 3 days
    3.  Hardware Rework & Test Plan Finalization (Parallel): 0.5 days
    4.  Integration and Final Validation Testing: 1 day
*   **Total Estimated Delay: 5.5 Days**

This new work will delay the project by an estimated **5.5 days** and add **$1,410.00** to the budget. I will await authorization before proceeding with component procurement and tasking the engineering team.
