# System Electrical & Thermal Specifications
#
# All values must be filled in by the responsible Electrical Engineer (EE).
# These values are CRITICAL for system safety validation.
# Do not proceed with testing until this document is complete and approved.

# --- POWER SYSTEM ---
# MOTOR_NOMINAL_VOLTAGE_V: 
# POWER_SUPPLY_MAX_VOLTAGE_V: 
# POWER_SUPPLY_MAX_CURRENT_A: 
#
# --- CURRENT LIMITS (AMPS) ---
# # Absolute maximum current the hardware can tolerate, even momentarily.
# # Exceeding this risks immediate component damage.
# ABSOLUTE_MAX_CURRENT_A: 
#
# # Peak current expected during startup or under heavy load (e.g., stall).
# # This should be a transient value.
# PEAK_MOTION_CURRENT_A: 
#
# # Expected current draw when the system is idle (powered on but not moving).
# IDLE_CURRENT_A:
#
# --- THERMAL ---
# # Maximum ambient temperature the unit is designed to operate in.
# MAX_OPERATING_TEMP_C: 
#
# # Derating factor for current at max operating temperature. 
# # E.g., at MAX_OPERATING_TEMP_C, max safe current is ABSOLUTE_MAX_CURRENT_A * (1 - THERMAL_DERATING_FACTOR)
# THERMAL_DERATING_FACTOR: 
#
# --- HARDWARE INTERFACE (CONFIRMATION) ---
# # These values are currently placeholders in the software. They must be confirmed.
# CURRENT_SENSOR_I2C_ADDRESS: "Confirm: 0x40 or specify correct"
# MOTOR_ENABLE_GPIO_PIN: "Confirm: 18 or specify correct"
